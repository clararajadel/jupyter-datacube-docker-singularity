# Jupyter-Datacube-Docker-Singularity
## Objective
- Run **Jupyter Notebooks** in A4Floods VM (**virtual machine**) without super-user root. 
- Install **datacube** to import sentinel images. 
- Use **Docker** to automate the set up between different universities = users. (Having your jupyter server run as a container is a must as it allows one to seamlessly move their lab, as it were, from one cloud to another). 
- Use **Singularity** to work in the ACube4Floods VM **without super-user root**.

## Workflow
1. Request access to Acube server (ssh key)
2. Locally: write Dockerfile, build Docker image and push to docker server
3. Acube server: build and run singularity image

# Generate key to connect with acube server
- Keys are saved in .ssh folder: one is the public (end with .pub). More info to customize your ssh key is found in: http://man.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/ssh-keygen.1?query=ssh-keygen&sec=1
- Create key:

```
$ cd .ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
if necessary make .ssh directory:
```
$ mkdir .ssh
```
- Get access to server (Emma)
- Access server: bind A4F VM 5200 to your local 5200
```
$ ssh -L 5200:localhost:5200 boku@acube4floods.eodchosting.eu
```

# Local set up

Docker image should be build locally because there is not super user root in the server to run Docker. To write a Dockerfile and build the docker image some previous steps should be done:

**1. Create workspace:** folder to save all files together + virtual environment. Docker will read files inside this workspace.

**2. Jupyter notebook:** 
    
   - install jupyter notebook
   - make directory called "nbs" to save all notebooks (this step is important: docker will only read notebooks inside this folder)
   - change jupyter configuration for:
        - launching notebooks contained inside "nbs" directory
        - avoiding authentication issues (adding your own password)
        - launching notebooks in local browser from acube server

**3. Docker**

   - write Dockerfile: file with instructions written for: 
        - creating an enviroment with all required libraries (included datacube)
        - launching jupyter notebooks inside "nbs" 
   - Build, run, tag and push docker image in docker server
  
  ## Create workspace
  - **Clone this repository** (if cloned you can avoid some of following steps):
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/clararajadel/jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity.git
  ```
- **Create local workspace**. This folder will contain all files required to build the docker image. Later it will be copied (using scp) or cloned (using git) in the VM to have access to these files from the VM.
```
$ mkdir local
```
- **Create and activate virtual environment** named "jupy-docker" using conda. The environment is created to use jupyter locally (without datacube) and verify that the new configuration works properly. This step is not mandatory, you can use an existing environment but I do not recommend it.
```
$ conda create -p /home/clara/projects/jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity/jupy-docker
$ source activate /home/clara/projects/jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity/jupy-docker
```
(all path is written because the environment is saved out from default path: /miniconda3/envs)
## Jupyter notebook
- **Activate conda environment** if it is not yet activated:
```
$ source activate /home/clara/projects/jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity/jupy-docker
```
- **Install jupyter and add ipykernel**. Ipykernel is a  Jupyter kernel to work with Python code in Jupyter notebooks.
```
$ conda install jupyter
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name jupy-docker --display-name "Python (jupy-docker)"
```
if necessary install ipykernel:
```
$ conda install ipykernel
```

- **Make directory "nbs"** inside "local" directory (this step is important: docker will only read notebooks inside this folder)
 ```
 $ cd local
 $ mkdir nbs
 ```
 - **Create password for jupyter**. The terminal will ask you for a password and then will print a string. Copy this string to paste it later in the jupyter configuration.
 ```
$ ipython -c "from notebook.auth import passwd; passwd()"
 ```
- **Customize jupyter configuration** creating jupyter.py file inside "local/conf" folder. (Note: default jupyter config can be accessed typing in the terminal: jupyter notebook --generate-config). We create a new config file to not change defaults in your local jupyter configuration. All info about jupyter configuration can be found here https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html.
```
$ mkdir conf
$ cd conf
$ nano jupyter.py
```
In jupyter.py:
```
import os
c = get_config()
# Kernel config
c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline'  # if you want plotting support always in your notebook
# Notebook config
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = 'nbs'
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*' # put your public IP Address here or * to allow all
c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
c.NotebookApp.allow_remote_access = True
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.password = u'...' # password copied in "create password for jupyter"
c.NotebookApp.port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5200))
c.NotebookApp.allow_root = True
c.NotebookApp.allow_password_change = True
c.ConfigurableHTTPProxy.command = ['configurable-http-proxy', '--redirect-port', '80']
```
 ---
 **Notes about jupyter.py config:**
 - nbs: root directory
 - allow_origin: to all (to launch it from the VM)
 - port: 5200 (use one port that is not used by other users in the VM)
 - allow_root: because the project is shared maybe I should change to False
 ---

- **Access jupyter notebook and save a .ipynb**: Write a small code in a .ipynb file and save it in the "nbs" folders. This step is necessary because if not "nbs" folder won't be cloned.
```
$ jupyter notebook --config=./conf/jupyter
```

## Docker
- **Install Docker in your local machine** (if necessary). Docker is installed out from this github repository so files are not visible for you. 

- **Create a [Dockerfile](#Dockerfile)**. This Dockerfile will contain instructions to:
1. Install Ubuntu
2. Install python and pip
3. Install all required packages --> create a file "requirements.txt" with all package names
4. Read an entrypoint.sh file to launch jupyter notebook according to configuration in jupyter.py --> create file "entrypoint.sh"

- **Create a [Docker Image](#Docker-Image)**. From Dockerfile a docker image will be build, tagged and run.

---

**Note: install Docker for Ubuntu in Windows 10:** 

I followed this documentation https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/. It didn't work: note that Docker Engine does not run on WSL, you have to have Docker For Windows installed on your host machine and you need to tell the Docker client where the Docker host is if you run Ubuntu in Windows 10: https://medium.com/@sebagomez/installing-the-docker-client-on-ubuntus-windows-subsystem-for-linux-612b392a44c4). For installing Docker Desktop in Windows: https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/. I had to use WSL2.

---

### Dockerfile

According to [Docker](#Docker) before creating the Dockerfile it should be added:
  a) "requirements.txt" file that contains the libraries. It allows to install all libraries with one line in Dockerfile.
  b) "entrypont.sh" that contains the order of opening jupyter notebook (with specific configuration) and will be read by Dockerfile.

- **Create requirements.txt** in /local with a list of required libraries:
    ```
    $ nano requirements.txt
    ```
    - Requirements.txt: [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/clararajadel/jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity/blob/main/local/requirements.txt)

- **Create entrypoint.sh** in /local/scripts (create scripts):
    ```
    $ mkdir scripts
    $ cd scripts
    $ nano entrypoint.sh
    ```
    - In entrypoint.sh add the order to open Jupyter Notebook following jupyter.py config. 
    - /app path is used because the environment in the Dockerfile will be named /app and singularity needs the entire path to build the image.
    ```
    /usr/local/bin/jupyter-notebook --config=/app/conf/jupyter.py
    ```
    - The format of entrypoint.sh should be changed (Ã­f not maybe you get error while building the image). In the terminal type:
    ```
    chmod +x entrypoint.sh
    ```
- **Create a file named Dockerfile** inside /local folder:
    ```
    $ nano Dockerfile
    ```
    - Dockerfile text: [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/clararajadel/jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity/blob/main/local/Dockerfile)
    
    ---
    **Notes about Dockerfile**

    - The base image is Ubuntu to work with Linux (but python base image I think also includes linux software).
    - The new working environment is /app. That is why the entrypoint.sh order includes /app in the config. (ENV: declare the name of environmental variables and WORKDIR: specifies the work environment)
    - Python and pip are installed
    - I need an environment, if not libraries such as scikit-learn won't work. The issue is because singularity doesn't work as docker regarding isolating the system. So, when using singularity, it is needed to install package or copy your data/files into a location where your user account has the permission. The normal place is "/opt", where all users have the rw access:  /opt is for "the installation of add-on application software packages".  /usr/local is "for use by the system administrator when installing software locally".
    - Then are followed the instructions to install datacube by the documentation: https://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ops/ubuntu.html#python-venv-installation. Moreover the documentation recommends making the installation in a virtual environment (odc), in this case we use: /opt. 
    - After that gdal is installed. Datacube doesn't need GDAL but we use it in our project.
    - Pip installs the requirements.txt libraries.
    - The final command is for reading the entrypoint.sh. You have to write all the filepath if you want to run the code (with Singularity is not possible writing: ./scripts/entrypoint.sh).
    - All commands that include <DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive> are created to avoid interaction while building the image.
    ---
### Docker Image
- **Build the image**: In the terminal, inside the folder where is the Dockerfile type:
```
$ docker build -t eodc-jupyter -f Dockerfile .
```
- **Create the resgistry image** (this step is in the A4Cube ppt of Dockers). If you avoid this step it won't work.
```
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
```
- **Tag your image** with the version (creating "other image": same ID, different name). This is the image to push in the docker server. The port of the computer from where is launched is specified.
```
$ docker tag eodc-jupyter localhost:5000/eodc-jupyter:1.0
```
- Finally, **push the docker image** to the server and it will become available in other machine through docker server.
```
$ docker push localhost:5000/eodc-jupyter:1.0
```

# Run singularity in server
- **Acces to A4Floods VM**. You can do local and remote port forwarding in one command --> write in the terminal:
```
$ ssh -L 5200:localhost:5200 -R 5201:localhost:5000 boku@acube4floods.eodchosting.eu
```
With above command, you bind your local port 5000(docker-registry port) to A4F VM port 5201, and bind A4F VM 5200 to your local 5200.

-  **Clone this repository**: jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity repository.
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/clararajadel/jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity.git
 ```
- **Allow singularity work in server** running the following command. (I did a similar step for running docker in Ubuntu for Windows, see in install Docker section)
```
$ export SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS=1
```
SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS: This is relevant if you want to use a registry that doesnât have https, and it speaks for itself. If you export the variable SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS you can force the software to not use https when interacting with a Docker registry. This use case is typically for use of a local registry. (https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/build_env.html)
- **Build and run singularity image**. You should build your image in the same folder as "nbs" folder.

    - **[- B /eodc:/eodc]** : the /eodc storage is not available inside the singularity container. Therefore, You need to bind the /eodc to the singularity container with -B option. [-B]: -B, --bind strings a user-bind path specification.  spec has the format src[:dest[:opts]], where src and dest are outside and inside paths.  If dest is not given, it is set equal to src.  Mount options ('opts') may be specified as 'ro' (read-only) or 'rw' (read/write, which is the default). Multiple bind paths can be given by a comma separated list. (https://sylabs.io/guides/3.1/user-guide/cli/singularity_exec.html)
```
$ cd jupyter-datacube-docker-singularity/local/
$ singularity build eodc-jupyter.simg docker://localhost:5201/eodc-jupyter:1.0
$ singularity exec -B /eodc:/eodc eodc-jupyter.simg  /app/scripts/entrypoint.sh
```
I can not push the .simg image because I cannot instal git-lfs (I can not use sudo)
-  **Access your jupyter notebooks** at your browser at url: localhost:5200

# Save new notebooks

# Errors
- When creating new .simg: tar error
```
gzip: /home/boku/.singularity/docker/sha256:32ce018fc27dbf5410317578350e089b00141c4428e42db7ac7081ffc3ae0b76.tar.gz: unexpected end of file
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
Cleaning up...
```
This is a problem of cache. Senmao said: you should go to the .singularity folder and remove cache. Delete content in docker and metadata folders.
```
$ cd .singularity
$ rm ~/.singularity/docker/*
$ rm ~/.singularity/metadata/*
```
- When I import datacube in the notebook from the .simg image: 
```
OSError: /app/opt/venv/lib/libgeos_c.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
Solution: deactivate all environments from the terminal (not forget bash):
```
$ conda deactivate
```
- If a new notebook pasted in "nbs" does not work maybe is because it is not in executable mode (you can check it typing "ls -la" in "nbs". To allow access:
```
$ chmod +x (name of the .py or .ipynb file)
```
